## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.10.0 or higher
- Dart SDK
- Supabase account
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd business_finance_manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Follow the instructions in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
   - Create your Supabase project
   - Run the SQL schema from `supabase_schema.sql` or `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
   - Get your Supabase URL and anon key

4. **Configure Supabase**
   - Update `lib/config/supabase_config.dart` with your Supabase credentials:
   ```dart
   class SupabaseConfig {
     static const String supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
     static const String supabaseAnonKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
   }
   ```

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Key Concepts

### Branch-User Relationship
Users are assigned to branches through the `branch_users` table with specific roles:
- Each user can have different roles in different branches
- Roles determine what actions a user can perform
- Business owners have access to all branches in their business

### Date-Based Permissions
- **Staff**: Can only view/edit today's data
- **Manager**: Can view/edit today and yesterday's data
- **Owner/Business Owner**: Can view/edit any date

### Cash Closing Flow
1. Record opening balance (from previous day's closing)
2. Track cash sales (calculated from cash counts)
3. Record all expenses
4. Count cash at end of day
5. Calculate discrepancy
6. Set next day's opening balance

### Credit Expenses
- Track purchases from suppliers on credit
- Mark expenses as paid/unpaid
- Filter and manage by supplier
- Track payment status over time

## Usage

### First Time Setup
1. Register a new account or login
2. Create a business (if you're a business owner)
3. Add your first branch
4. Start recording daily financial operations

### Daily Operations
1. Select a branch from the dashboard
2. Choose the date (subject to role permissions)
3. Record financial entries:
   - Cash expenses
   - Credit expenses
   - Cash balance counts
   - Card sales
   - Online sales
   - QR/UPI payments
   - Dues (receivables/payables)
4. Complete cash closing at end of day

### Managing Suppliers
1. Navigate to Supplier Management (Business Owner only)
2. Add supplier details
3. Record credit expenses linked to suppliers
4. Track payment status and manage dues

### Viewing Reports
1. Access Owner Dashboard (Business Owner/Owner only)
2. Select date range
3. Choose branches to analyze
4. View aggregated sales, expenses, and profit data

## Development

### Code Style
- Follow Dart/Flutter style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Maintain consistent formatting

### Adding New Features
1. Create model in `lib/models/`
2. Add database methods in `lib/services/database_service.dart`
3. Create screen in `lib/screens/`
4. Update navigation and permissions as needed

### Testing
```bash
flutter test
```

### Building for Production

**Android:**
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**iOS:**
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

## Configuration

### Supabase Setup
See `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for detailed database setup instructions.

### Environment Variables
Supabase credentials are stored in `lib/config/supabase_config.dart`. For production, consider using environment variables or secure storage.

## Security Considerations

- Row Level Security (RLS) should be configured in Supabase
- User authentication handled by Supabase Auth
- Role-based permissions enforced at app level
- Date-based edit restrictions prevent unauthorized modifications
- Branch-level data isolation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Supabase connection errors:**
- Verify Supabase URL and anon key in `supabase_config.dart`
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure Supabase project is active

**Permission errors:**
- Verify user role in `branch_users` table
- Check RLS policies in Supabase
- Ensure user is assigned to the branch

**Data not syncing:**
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify database service methods
- Check for error logs in console
